DBL-alpha tags are small regions of the PfEMP1 protein that can be PCR amplified and are classified into six expression groups depending on the number of cysteines and presence of
certain motifs within the tag region (Bull et al 2007). This plugin extends bioruby's amino acid class, Bio::Sequence::AA by adding methods to analyze DBLa sequences tags.
If you apply this method please quote,
Bull et al “An approach to classifying sequence tags sampled from Plasmodium falciparum var genes..” Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology 154 (1) (July): 98–102. doi:10.1016/j.molbiopara.2007.03.011.

= Installation
You need to have Ruby installed on your system. This plugin has been tested on Ruby 1.9.2-p290. See http://rubylang.info/ for
information on Ruby and how to install it on your system. Once Ruby 1.9.2 is installed type the following command in the terminal to
install the gem. This will install the bioruby gem if it is not already installed on your system.

 gem install bio-dbla-classifier

= Uninstall

 gem uninstall bio-dbla-classifier

= Usage
 #create an instace of Bioruby's Bio::Sequence::AA class with methods to classify and describe DBL-alpha tags.

 require 'bio-dbla-classifier'

 seq ='DIGDIVRGRDMFKSNPEVEKGLKAVFRKINNGLTPQAKTHYADEDGSGNYVKLREDWWKANRDQVWKAITCKAPQSVHYFIKTSHGTRGFTSHGKCGRNETNVPTNLDYVPQYLR'
 dbl_seq = Bio::Sequence::AA.new(seq)

 #get the positions of limited variability
 puts dbl_seq.polv1 #=> MFKS
 puts dbl_seq.polv2 #=> LRED
 puts dbl_seq.polv3 #=> KAIT
 puts dbl_seq.polv4 #=> PTNL

 #get the number of cysteines in the tag
 puts dbl_seq.cys_count #=> 2

 #get the distinct sequence identifier
 puts dbl_seq.dsid #=>MFKS-LRED-KAIT-2-PTNL-115

 #get the cyspolv group for this tag
 puts dbl_seq.cyspolv_group #=> 1


 #get the block sharing group for this tag
 #puts dbl_seq.bs_group #to be implemented

 #get the length of the tag
 puts dbl_seq.size #=> 115

 #if input file is a fasta file
 seq_file = "sequences.fasta"

 #process each entry in the file
 Bio::FlatFile.open(seq_file).each do |entry|
  tag = Bio::Sequence::AA.new(entry.seq)
  puts "#{entry.definition},#{tag.dsid},#{tag.cys_count},#{tag.cyspolv_group}"
